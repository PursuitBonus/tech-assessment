import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const ChatScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Chat')),
      body: const Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(24.0),
        child: SingleChildScrollView(

            '''
Chat screen placeholder. Dialogs here ...

This is where 1-on-1 and marketplace-related chat will be implemented.

Architecture plan:
- Messages will be managed via ChatCubit (BLoC)
- Chat service will support Firebase Messaging or AMQP
- Message syncing and storage will support offline mode
- UI will use lazy-loaded message lists and typing indicators

I would use the:
- AMQP (RabbitMQ/EMQX for just amazing scalability)
  (my experience is 250k users with over 1 mln/sec messages, with queues, namespaces, projects, etc...)
or
- Azure SignalR Service (enterprise scaling)

---

How this would work from the architecture side:

ChatCubit (BLoC):
- Manages message list, typing indicators, and sending state
- Emits:
    - ChatInitial, ChatLoading, ChatLoaded, ChatError
    - Plus a stream of List<ChatMessage>

ChatService abstraction:

abstract class ChatService {
  Stream<ChatMessage> subscribeToMessages(String chatId);
  Future<void> sendMessage(String chatId, ChatMessage message);
}

Implementations:
- FirebaseChatService (Firestore or FCM)
- AmqpChatService (RabbitMQ, EMQX)
- AzureSignalRChatService (WebSocket/SignalR)

All services are injected into the Cubit — makes switching between providers a non-issue.

Other things to think about:
- Messages could be cached locally with Hive/Isar for offline use
- UI will use ListView.builder, scroll controller, and MessageBubble widgets
- Typing indicators and delivery receipts can be added later if needed

That’s the idea. and i think that having chat in such an app is not a bad idea
            ''',

          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
