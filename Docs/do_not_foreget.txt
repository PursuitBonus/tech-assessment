1. UI move the sell btm to the screen with listings
buy process will accure after selecting item to buy

2. Withdrawal card managing etc are hardcoded so the of course should be added to the cubit structures 

3. Login screen now done as the part of the account screen - but it might be separated in the independent screen and word as a dialog in pair with register (if required)
Now that I hope makes no sense in the way it operates
The issue with the login dialogs within the apps with segmented functionality (partly accessible for un-logined users) is the proper navigation
Using the Dialog (better UI view  from my POW) means the cancel login problem - when user decides not to login after the dialog was shown - so to cancel that and handle the "appropriate" nav sequence we have to manage it for example via separately created navigation cubit - managing states programmatically, what is the quite long way for the test task.

So we keep that in head and continue using the inline widget approach on current UX.
